        <h1>Thomas Michael Shelby</h1>
         <p class="pap">Thomas Michael Shelby was born in Small Heath, Birmingham, England in 1890, the son of an Irish immigrant
            father and a mother of Romani extraction. He was the son of Arthur Shelby, Sr. and the brother of Arthur
            Shelby, John Shelby, Ada Thorne, and Finn Shelby, and the brothers were involved with the organized crime
            gang, the Peaky Blinders, during their youths. They were both drafted into the British Army during World War
            I, and Tommy Shelby served as a sapper and a Sergeant-Major in the Small Heath Rifles; his childhood friend
            Freddie Thorne once saved his life. His actions at the 1914 Battle of Mons saved thousands of Allied lives,
            and he was also recognized for his bravery at the Battle of the Somme and the Battle of Verdun. His flawless
            conduct earned him the Military Medal and the Distinguished Conduct Medal.

            Rise to power

            Shelby in 1919

            After returning home from the war, Shelby became a respected figure in the neighborhood. His brother Arthur
            became the leader of the Peaky Blinders, but he relied on Tommy to be the brains behind his criminal
            enterprise. Tommy fixed horse races by going to a young Chinese girl who could perform a powder trick on the
            horse, and he also secretly (and accidentally) stole an arms shipment from Belfast in 1919, leading to
            Inspector Chester Campbell being sent to investigate the gang's operations. Arthur's mental health began to
            deteriorate due to war trauma and his father's abuse, and he eventually decided to cede control of the gang
            to Tommy.

            Shelby's expansion of the gang's involvement in the racetrack scene brought him into conflict with the
            Birmingham Boys under Billy Kimber, and he also entered into conflict with the Lee Family after they
            provoked him into a fight by insulting his mother. Campbell had undercover policewoman Grace Burgess attempt
            to learn about the  location of the guns by becoming a barmaid at The Garrison Pub, which was frequented by
            the Peaky Blinders gang.  The two eventually became enamored, and Shelby saved her from being raped by Kimber
            after having offered her up as a "sweetener" to a partnership with him against the Lee Family, their shared
            rivals.

            Shelby also met with Inspector Campbell, and he told him that he was a businessman; he agreed with
            Campbell's desire for peace in the city, as business could thrive. Shelby offered to prevent Freddie Thorne
            from returning to the city (as Thorne had become a communist and had impregnated his sister) and to return
            the stolen arms shipment of 25 Lewis machine-guns, </p> <p> 50 carbines, and 10,000 rounds of ammunition in exchange
            for Campbell having the Chief Inspector of Gloucestershire call off Billy Kimber's corrupt policemen when
            Shelby made his move on the racetrack business, and in exchange for Campbell turning a blind eye to the
            Peaky Blinders. Shelby gained Kimber's trust by having his men protect Kimber's bookmakers, and Kimber
            decided to ally with Shelby. However, Shelby secretly arranged for his brother John to marry Esme Lee to
            form an alliance with the Lees, and he planned to betray Kimber and take over his racecourses. Shelby also
            began a relationship with Grace Burgess, who developed feelings for him, while also focusing on her mission.
            Burgess helped Shelby deal with his IRA troubles, protecting him from the IRA brigadier Malacki Byrne and
            his accomplice Keith Maguire when they attempted to shoot him at the pub. The two then fell in love, and
            Shelby took note of Burgess' capabilities. Having gained Shelby's trust, Shelby hired her as a book keeper,
            entrusting her with the company's financial records. She discovered that payments were being made to Daniel
            Owen, and Arthur told her that Owen's death had been faked to fool the Mafia. Burgess told Campbell that the
            arms shipment was hidden in Owen's grave, as it had been dug deep, lined with lead, and was empty. Campbell
            succeeded in capturing the shipment, and he also told Kimber of Shelby's plans to betray him, having been
            informed of the plan by Burgess.


            Shelby shooting Billy Kimber dead

            Shelby had his men prepare to head to the Cheltenham races to ambush Kimber, but Shelby was surprised when
            he heard reports that two truckloads of Kimber's men were heading towards the pub. He discovered that he had
            been betrayed by Burgess, as she was the only person who had known about his secretive "Black Star Day"
            plans, and she had tearfully told Shelby that she would not be at the pub when he returned because she had
            done something horrible to him. Shelby and a handful of men confronted Kimber's men on the street, and
            Kimber boasted superior firepower and manpower. However, Daniel Owen and Freddie Thorne arrived behind the
            Birmingham Boys with a Lewis machine-gun. Kimber said that the dispute was solely between him and Shelby, so
            he fired two shots at Shelby, with one injuring Shelby and the other killing Owen, who had ran to protect
            him. Shelby then recovered and shot Kimber once in the forehead, killing him. He then told the rest of his
            men to return to their wives and families, inspired by his own sister Ada's brave act of walking between the
            men and asking them who in their family would wear black for them when they died. The Birmingham Boys left
            Small Heath for good, and Shelby and his men held a solemn funeral for Owen before celebrating their
            victory.</p>
